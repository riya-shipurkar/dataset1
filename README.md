# SENTIMENT ANALYSIS
To analyze if the text is positive and negative. 

To analyze a text based on its sentiment, first we should analyze if there are more positive sentences or negative. This can be analyzed by the usage of words or the meaning of the sentences. Then select the most impactful sentences and analyze if they are positive or negative. After doing so, based on how many positives and negatives we get, decide the output of the text; that is decide whether the text is overall positive or negative. 


First step: analyze the text. Check if they imply positive or negative intenstion (done in index.cpp)
Second step: Based on the analyzation, output whether the text is positive or negative (done in index2.cpp)
